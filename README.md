# Project Summary:

The project aims to develop a rain prediction system based on weather data using data mining techniques. The model design incorporates two primary algorithms: a decision tree-based algorithm and a logistic regression-based algorithm. The dataset utilized in the project is "Australian Weather Data (2005-2015)" sourced from Kaggle, encompassing approximately 10 years of daily weather observations from various locations across Australia.

The dataset comprises diverse weather parameters including temperature extremes (MinTemp and MaxTemp), precipitation (Rainfall), evaporation (Evaporation), sunshine duration (Sunshine), wind characteristics (WindGusDir, WindGusSpeed, WindDir9am, WindDir3pm, WindSpeed9am, WindSpeed3pm), humidity levels (Humidity9am, Humidity3pm), atmospheric pressure (Pressure9am, Pressure3pm), cloud cover (Cloud9am, Cloud3pm), and temperature measurements (Temp9am, Temp3pm), alongside indicators for rain occurrences (RainToday) and subsequent day rain forecasts (RainTomorrow).

The research objective centers on predicting rainfall based on the previously mentioned weather parameters. The primary research questions guiding this investigation are: "How do weather variables influence rainfall in Australia?" and "Can historical weather data effectively predict rain occurrences?"

To address these questions, the project will employ two classes of models: a decision tree-based algorithm and a logistic regression-based algorithm. The decision tree algorithm will leverage the hierarchical structure of the data to predict rain occurrences based on weather conditions, while logistic regression will model the probability of rainfall based on the given weather parameters.

The decision tree-based algorithm will analyze the dataset's attributes to make decisions about the likelihood of rain, utilizing features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure to partition the data and predict rain occurrences. In contrast, logistic regression will estimate the probability of rain based on a linear combination of the weather variables, providing insights into the significance of each parameter in predicting rainfall.

Both algorithms will be implemented and assessed for accuracy using metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score. The project will also investigate feature importance to identify key weather variables for rain prediction. Python, along with libraries like pandas and scikit-learn, will be used for data processing, model building, and evaluation, facilitating the creation of a robust rain prediction system from Australian weather data.
